# Superfund Me

Reviving an old idea - mapping Superfund environmental sites near you and around the United States
using OpenStreetMap

## Why map a Superfund site?

* public interest, environmental concern
* situation on the ground often different from TIGER and other imported data
* site often includes service roads and other features not in TIGER and other imported data
* changes frequently
